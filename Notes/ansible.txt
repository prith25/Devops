Ansible:

Ansible helps in creating and managing
1. IT automation : instructions are written to automate the IT professional's work
2. Configuration management : Consistency of all systems in the infrastructure is maintained
3. Automatic deployment : Applications are deployed automatically on a variety of environments

Ansible Architecture:

1. Setup a local machine and install Ansible. local machine will have all the instruction and power to control where we can push it to other nodes.

2. Nodes are the systems to be configured. They are controlled by the local machine

3. Local machine has module which is a collection of configuration code files. these configuration code files are called playbooks

4. Local machine also has a second job which is to manage the inventory. inventory is a document that groups the nodes under specific labels

Playbook:

it is where we create the instructions that you write to define the architecture of your hardware. so the playbook is really just a set of instructions that configure the different nodes that you have and each of those set of instructions is written in a language called "yaml" <- a standard language used for configuration server environments
